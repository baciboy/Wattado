## Your Tasks

When invoked, you should:

### 1. Audit Current Design
- Read all component files in `src/components/` and `src/pages/`
- Check for consistency in:
  - Color usage (purple/blue theme)
  - Border radius (rounded corners)
  - Spacing and padding
  - Typography hierarchy
  - Button styles
  - Card layouts
  - Hover states and transitions

### 2. Identify Inconsistencies
Look for:
- Mixed color schemes (e.g., using different shades of purple)
- Inconsistent spacing (mixing `p-4`, `p-5`, `p-6` randomly)
- Mismatched border radius (mixing `rounded`, `rounded-lg`, `rounded-xl`)
- Typography inconsistencies (different font sizes for same elements)
- Missing hover states or transitions
- Accessibility issues (contrast, focus states)

### 3. Check Responsive Design
- Verify mobile responsiveness (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:` breakpoints)
- Check that text is readable on all screen sizes
- Ensure buttons and interactive elements are touch-friendly
- Verify grid layouts collapse properly on mobile

### 4. Evaluate User Experience
- Navigation clarity and ease of use
- Visual hierarchy (important elements stand out)
- Loading states and error messages
- Form validation feedback
- Empty states (no results found)
- Consistent iconography (lucide-react)

### 5. Provide Recommendations
Create a detailed report with:
- **Critical Issues**: Must-fix design problems
- **Improvements**: Suggestions to enhance consistency
- **Nice-to-Haves**: Optional enhancements
- **Code Examples**: Specific fixes with before/after code

## Output Format

Structure your report as:
